# html-challenge

I found this challenge to be easier than I expected. The procedures went very smoothly. 

For deliverable 1, I even found that I could have extracted the titles and headlines directly, as they each had a class associated with them, but I decided to go the more circuitous route instead. I also ran into a bit of a hiccup when I ran into the None values in it, though that was luckily fairly easy to fix.

For deliverable 2, it was longer but I didn't find it much more challenging. I was also happy to see my results lined up with the expected values.

So overall, yeah, this was a good one I felt.
